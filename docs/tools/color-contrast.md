As defined by [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast), the conformance levels measured here are AA and AAA. AAA is a higher standard to meet than AA. Since large text is generally easier to distinguish from its background than smaller text, the contrast standards for each level are lower for larger text (font size >= 18px).

- Level **AA (large text)** compliance: For large text, contrast ratio should be at least **3:1**.
- Level **AA** compliance: For regular-sized text, contrast ratio should be at least **4.5:1**.
- Level **AAA (large text)** compliance: For large text, contrast ratio should be at least **4.5:1**.
- Level **AAA** compliance: For regular-sized text, contrast ratio should be at least **7:1**.
