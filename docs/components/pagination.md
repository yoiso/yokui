Pagination is a method for allowing a user to view a subset of sorted data into a more comprehensible format. It allows a user to progress to the next or previous view, or choose a page number you want manually.

The `Pagination` component provides a styled list of links used to navigate through a paginated list.  By default,
the component includes a 'previous page' button, a 'next page' button, and one link.

The pagination component will display a maximum of five pages. When more than five are provided, the component will shrink with ellipses to show the first, last, active, and pages adjacent to the active page.

Do's         | Don'ts
-------------|----------
Use when it is unsuitable to display all the data on a single page/screen. | Do not use when you donâ€™t want the user to pause for navigating to the next page. Instead consider simply having a scrolling vertical view.
Use when the dataset is in some way ordered. |

```jsx

```jsx

//description=The following is an example of pagination with extra props:
class PaginationAdvanced extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleSelect = this.handleSelect.bind(this);
    this.state = {activePage: 1};
  }

  handleSelect(event, selectedEvent) {
    const newActivePage = selectedEvent.newActivePage;
    this.setState({activePage: newActivePage});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Pagination items={7}
                    activePage={this.state.activePage}
                    onSelect={this.handleSelect}/>
        <div className="maxl">Current Page: {this.state.activePage}</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

<PaginationAdvanced/>
```
