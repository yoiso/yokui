title: 8-point grid
---

Pivotal UI uses an 8-point grid system for sizing, spacing, and laying out components relative to one another. This means that any padding, margin, button height, etc. is always a **multiple of 8 pixels**. This makes it easy to compose Pivotal UI components together neatly and consistently. For a deeper dive into how Pivotal arrived at the 8-point grid, [read this article](https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632).

## Using the 8-point grid

Pivotal UI incorporates the 8-point grid in several ways for different use cases.

### Form, Panel & Table components

Components like the `Form`, `Panel` and `Table` have the 8-point grid built in, so using them means getting the benefits of the 8-point grid for free. For example, the `Form` lays out all of its fields and labels according to the grid. For more information, see the individual component pages.

### Grid & FlexCol components

When more control is needed over layout, or when implementing custom components, the `Grid` and `FlexCol` components can be used to lay out content according to the 8-point grid. For more information, see the [Grids page](/grids).

### Margin & padding modifiers

The margin and padding CSS modifier classes (e.g. `mtxl`, `paxxl`) make it simple to add spacing around elements in increments of 8 pixels. The `l` indicates 8 pixels, `xl` indicates 16 pixels, and so on. For more information, see the [Whitespace page](/whitespace).
